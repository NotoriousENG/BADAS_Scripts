[NAME=???]Hello!

Welcome to the world of Game Development!

[NAME=Michael]My name is Michael, and this is NPC Dialogue.

A pretty easy way to handle linear dialogue is with text files.

Here you can edit what is being said without having to edit every line in Unity.

Trust me, it can get annoying very quickly having to click on textboxes and such.

Of course, if you wanted nonlinear dialogue, you would need a way to implement player choice, a way to record it, and a way to navigate a file or two.

EndQueue

** Multiple choice ** (Needs work)

But you'd probably still want everything in the same file right?

[CHOICE=Y] YES
[CHOICE=N] NO

{Y} Well you're in luck, that's what we're doing here!

{N} Ah, well you can really do a number of things, but I'll tell you my way.

You need 2 things really.

1) You need a way to mark choices.
2) You need a way to mark the next line of dialogue to say.

With these you could probably make a system to handle elementary branching dialouge.

Too much branching dialogue could be a headache for this system, if you think this is necessary for your game, you'll definitely want to develop a more modular system..
